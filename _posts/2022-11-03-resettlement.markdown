This article examines the challenges and policies surrounding worker resettlement in the Chinese coal sector, which has undergone significant contraction in recent years due to the need to achieve climate policy goals. State-owned enterprises dominate the sector, and the displacement of workers has important implications for both the affected workers and the achievement of climate action goals. The article provides insights into the strategies employed by SOEs to address workforce contraction, including internal and external resettlement, job fairs, vocational training, and contract termination. The findings highlight the varied outcomes of worker resettlement programs and the importance of government support in addressing the challenges posed by the contraction of the coal sector.
