Our research on obesity and living conditions is generally a quite common topic for those interested in the subject. With our findings, we can share with the community our findings of which aspects in the living standards contributed most to the cause or the correlation to the obesity rate on a macro level. This would benefit studies that focus on obesity or health in general, and it can also help the government to advocate policy that aims to reduce the obesity rate and promote healthy living.
