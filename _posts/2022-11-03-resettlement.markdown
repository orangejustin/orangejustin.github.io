This article discusses the challenges and strategies for worker resettlement in China's coal sector, which has undergone significant contraction in response to climate policy goals. State-owned enterprises dominate the sector, and their actions on worker displacement will have important implications for both displaced workers and climate action. The article presents case studies of SOE worker resettlement programs and identifies common categories of disposition options for displaced workers, such as internal and external resettlement and contract termination. The article highlights the need for continued government support for displaced workers, particularly given the contracting coal sector and changing workforce demographics.
