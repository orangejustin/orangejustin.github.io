This presentation covers the labor resettlement of state-owned coal enterprises in China, examining 7 cases and highlighting the difficulties faced by employees in finding new jobs, such as limited skills and education. The use of visual plots, such as pie charts, helps to illustrate the proportion of labor resettlement solutions adopted by these companies.
