# Personal Portfolio

This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [the repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

I am also referring the layout from [this repo](https://github.com/zwcolin/zwcolin.github.io) done by Colin.

# Website
I wish more people had a better chance of getting to know me through this website. There are many items that I have not included in the site due to ongoing processes or privacy issues.
